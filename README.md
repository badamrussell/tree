Search Tree
===========
Ruby

An exercise into building a Custom Tree Node class for Tree Search searches. Like a binary tree, but here you can specify the number of children for each node (so it doesn't have to be 2). This can be used for Breadth-First-Search (BFS) and Depth-First-Search (DFS).


###Implemented Features
+ Can customize the number of children for each node.
+ Uses a queue (FIFO) for BFS
+ Uses a stack (LIFO) for DFS
+ Searches Tree Recursively
